# Git Commit Message Generator

This is a simple commit message generator in which you will have some prompt to fill out and a commit message will be generated for you to copy and paste.

## Installation
Clone the repo, extract the files inside an empty folder and run the following:

```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies for the project. To run the app you will need to run the following:
```
npm run dev
```

## Technologies
I'm using `React 18.2.0` for this project.
